# Computer Graphics Lab – Assignment 1

## Basic Graphics Primitives

### Objective

To write a C++ program using the `graphics.h` library to draw the following basic graphics primitives in a single graphics window:

1. Straight Line
2. Circle
3. Rectangle
4. Triangle

---

## Technologies Used

- C++
- `graphics.h`
- `conio.h`
- GCC / MinGW
- Visual Studio Code

---

## Program File

**File:** `CGM_LabAssignment1_BasicShapes.cpp`

---

## Graphics Primitives

### 1. Straight Line

A straight line is drawn between two specified points using the `line()` function.

### 2. Circle

A circle is drawn using the `circle()` function by specifying its center coordinates and radius.

### 3. Rectangle

A rectangle is drawn using the `rectangle()` function by specifying its top-left and bottom-right coordinates.

### 4. Triangle

A triangle is created by drawing three connected straight lines using the `line()` function.

---

## Functions Used

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `initgraph()` | Initializes the graphics mode |
| `line()` | Draws a straight line |
| `circle()` | Draws a circle |
| `rectangle()` | Draws a rectangle |
| `getch()` | Waits for a key press |
| `closegraph()` | Closes the graphics mode |

---

## Header Files Used

### graphics.h

Used for graphics-related functions such as drawing lines, circles, and rectangles.

### conio.h

Used for the `getch()` function to pause the graphics window until a key is pressed.

---

## Output

The program displays the following four graphics primitives in a single graphics window:

- Straight Line
- Circle
- Rectangle
- Triangle

---

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- GCC / MinGW
- `graphics.h` library
- `conio.h` library
- Visual Studio Code or any compatible C++ IDE

---

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this assignment, the following concepts are understood:

- Basics of computer graphics programming
- Graphics initialization
- Coordinate system
- Drawing basic graphics primitives
- Use of `graphics.h` functions
- Creating geometric shapes using coordinates
